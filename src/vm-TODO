TODO
----

* code generation

* implement VM_INSTR_PUSH_LOCALS

* implement the equivalent of dres_scope_push (ie. pushing
  new locals before calling  a function)

* implement VM_INSTR_GET_FIELD

* implement VM_INSTR_GET (get and push the value of a local on the stack)

* symbolic code dumping

- code saving/loading

- implement VM exceptions (and related stack cleanup)

- hide vm_* types at the DRES API level (provide equivalent dres_* types
  and wrapper DRES functions where necessary)

- revise instruction format and encoding / decoding (better ratio of
  instruction-specific vs. general code)

more general/architectural stuff:

- debugging support (callback-based single stepping control)

- garbage collection (not needed currently because of our language
  limitations)





Potential / Probable Problems
-----------------------------
- recursive VM invocations (resolver -> actions -> resolver -> other actions...)


Architectural / Philosophical Questions
---------------------------------------

- merge type into vm_value_t

  This could make the interface to some of the stack-handling functions
  more handy (especially those that now return a type and write a value to
  a vm_value_t pointer...). We could also get rid of vm_stack_entry_t
  altogether. Stack entries would simply become vm_value_t's.
