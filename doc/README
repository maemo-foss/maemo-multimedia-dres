II. Rule File Syntax

Rule files are line-oriented plain text files. A rule file consists of rules
and comments. Comments start with a hashmark (#) and end at the next newline
(\n) or at the end of file whichever comes first. Comments are discarded
during lexical analysis without further processing. Rules are of the format

target: optional_prerequisites
	optional_actions

Prerequisites is a space separated list of target names and/or variable
names (prefixed with a dollar signs ($)). Every action must always start with
one or more tab (\t) and have one of the following formats:

    function(optional_argument_list)  invoke function with arguments
    $variable = value		      assign value to keystore variable
    &variable = value		      assign value to dres variable
