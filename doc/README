II. Rule File Syntax

A rule file consists of comments and and rules. Comments start with a
hashmark (#) and end at the next newline (\n) or at the end of file if
there are no more newlines. Comments are removed and ignored during
lexical analysis. Rules are of the format

target: optional_prerequisites
	optional_actions


Prerequisites can be a space separated list of target names and/or variable
name (prefixed with a dollar sign ($)). Every action must always start with
one or more tabulator characters (\t) and have one of the following formats:

	function(optional_argument_list)  invoke function with arguments
	$variable = value		  assign value to keystore variable
	&variable = value		  assign value to dres variable
